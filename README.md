# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools I use. The goal is to have a consistent and portable setup across different machines.
## Programs Included
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - Built off of [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Move the files to your `~/.config` directory with the exception of `.zshrc` and `p10k.zsh`, which both belong in your home directory
- Optionally, run `copy-dotfiles.sh` to copy your own dotfiles into the repository
