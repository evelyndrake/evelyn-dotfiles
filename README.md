# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools I use. The goal is to have a consistent and portable setup across different machines.
## Programs Included
- Zsh
- Neovim
- Sketchybar
- Joplin
- Visual Studio Code

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Move the files to your `~/.config` directory with the exception of `.zshrc`, which belongs in your home directory
- Optionally, run `copy-dotfiles.sh` to copy your own dotfiles into the repository
